									<h2 class="title-objetcives">Origins</h2>
									<div class="origin-item">
										<p>The Table Club was initially established in 2009 with the support of some of Australia’s oldest and most influential family offices. The aim was to form a mutually beneficial network to fulfil family offices’ unique needs. Since inception, our membership has grown from the founding families to include a large portion of the Top 250 Family Offices in Australia & New Zealand, each with wealth size exceeding US$200 million. The Top 250 Family Offices currently exceed US$230 billion of wealth and are a significant part of the institutional investor landscape.</p>
										<p>Through the encouragement of our founding members, The Table Club has established its chapters in six other regions so far: 
										</p>
										<ul class="country-list">
											<li>Europe</li>
											<li>North America</li>
											<li>Latin America</li>
											<li>Singapore</li>
											<li>India</li>
											<li>Hong Kong.</li>
										</ul>	
										<p>Going forward, we plan to add further chapters based in China, Japan and the Middle East by 2014.

							<div class="wpar-origins-objectives">
								<div class="activities origins">
									<h2 class="title-objetcives">Activities</h2>
									<div class="activities-item">
										In order to further these objectives, we hold a range of activities to promote productive interactions and relationships. Our core activities are the hosting of small exclusive dinners and lunches for the Principals and Executives of our Family Office members. 
									</div>
									<div class="activities-item">
										Our “Principal-only” events are held twice per annum for each of our international chapters, and every second month in Australia. Our concept is that member Principals may sit at any Table chapter thus providing them with a truly global network of similar minded family office principals. The annual membership fee covers the cost of all principal only events as well as our other mixed family office lunches and workshops.
									</div>
									<div class="activities-item">
										We are pleased that over 140 Australian and New Zealand family offices have participated in the Australian events since inception. Furthermore, over 150 family offices have now attended our global events across 6 other regions. We have held over 200 events since our inception and now enjoy strong support for our global events from the various members around the world.
